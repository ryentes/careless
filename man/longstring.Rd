\title{Identifies the longest string of identical consecutive responses for each observation}
\usage{
longstring(x, avg = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix of data (e.g. item responses)}

\item{avg}{logical indicating whether to additionally return the average length of identical consecutive responses}
}
\description{
Takes a matrix of item responses and, beginning with the second column (i.e., second item)
compares each column with the previous one to check for matching responses.
For each observation, the length of the maximum uninterrupted string of
identical responses is returned. Additionally, can return the average length of uninterrupted string of identical responses.
}
\examples{
careless_long <- longstring(careless_dataset, avg = FALSE)
careless_avg <- longstring(careless_dataset, avg = TRUE)
boxplot(careless_avg$longstr) #produce a boxplot of the longstring index
boxplot(careless_avg$avgstr)
