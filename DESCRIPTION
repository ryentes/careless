Description: Careless or insufficient effort responding in surveys, i.e. responding to items without regard to their content, 
            is a common occurence in surveys. These types of responses constitute significant problems for data quality 
            leading to distortions in data analysis and hypothesis testing, such as spurious correlations. 
            The R package careless provides solutions designed to detect such careless / insufficient effort responses
            by allowing easy calculation of indices proposed in the literature. 
            It currently supports the calculation of Longstring, Even-Odd Consistency, Psychometric Synonyms/Antonyms, 
            Mahalanobis Distance, and Intra-individual Response Variability (also termed Inter-item Standard Deviation).
